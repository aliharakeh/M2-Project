    "# Pros of RAKE\n",
    "- This can be done context free per document\n",
    "- Can generate more complicated phrases that might be have more meaning than individual words.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Pros of TF-IDF\n",
    "- This is good for choosing actual keywords rather than phrases\n",
    "- Seems to be better at finding the words that are actually relevant (at least for my project) and getting rid of everyday speech fluff.\n",
    "- This might be a lot better for matching domain specific keywords because it doesn’t flag every day common words as being important.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cons of RAKE\n",
    "- It doesn’t have the context of outside word usage so can’t tell as easily what is most important to this specific document\n",
    "- If you don’t have a comprehensive list of stop words the phrases can get quite long and less useful.\n",
    "- It ends up with a lot more filler words and adverbs which is not a good thing in my case but could be quite useful in some cases\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cons of TF-IDF\n",
    "- You need a lot of other documents and examples of text for this to even work\n",
    "- It’s not as good for finding multi-word phrases and matching up common co-occurrences"
